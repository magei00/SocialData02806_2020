    "\n",
    "### A) Segal and Heer paper\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is the Oxford English Dictionary's defintion of a narrative?**\n",
    "\n",
    "“an account of a series of events, facts, etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections between them.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3? Explain why in a few words.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 comparing budget forecasts with reality is a great visualization because even though its simple, it elegantly conveys the narrative through usage of the martini glass structure. The visualiztion shows a good amount of information and the layout is consitent ensuring that reader doesn't get disoriented and is able to understand the story. Finally the visualization uses a tacit tutorial to ensure that the reader knows which interactions are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What's the point of Figure 7?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 7 shows an analysis of tactics used for visual narrative as well as narrative structures used acros mutliple genres of visualization. The figure highlights trends in specific genres, it showcases which strategies are commonly used as well as which are under utilized. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and Narrative structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common choices are shown in the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Visual Structuring        | Highlighting        | Transition Guidance | Ordering           | Interactivity                  | Messaging           |\n",
    "|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| Consitent Visual Platform | Feature Distinction | Object Continuity   | User Directed Path | Filtering / Selection / Search | Caption / Headlines |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visual Narrative\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most common choice for visual structuring is a consistent platform. Feature distinction is by far the most popular highlighting strategy. Object continuety is the most used transition gudiance strategy, closely followed by animated transition s as well as familiar objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Narrative Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "    User directed path is by far the most used Ordering strategy. Filtering/selection/search is almost always used for interactivity. Captions/Headlines are used very frequently closly followed by annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Check out Figure 8 and section 4.3. What is your favorite genre of narrative visualization? Why? What is your least favorite genre? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide show is great for narrative visualization because it can utilize a vast amount of strategies in regards of both visual narrative as well as narrative structure. It can utilize interactivity well, letting the user explore at their own pace and to the desired extend, while making sure the narrative is pressentend in the intended order from start to end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magazine style is the most limiting medium in regards of which narrative strategies can be utiliez and is therfore the least interresting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B) Explanatory data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What are the three key elements to keep in mind when you design an explanatory visualization?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The first key point is to ask yourself, what results you want to communicate to the audience. \n",
    "    * The second keypoint is to allow exploration by utilizing user interactions in order to further engage the audience.\n",
    "    * The third keypoint is you should know the audience and design the visualization accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In the video I talk about (1) overview first, (2) zoom and filter, (3) details on demand.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Go online and find a visualization that follows these principles (don't use one from the video).**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <img src=\"FacebookVisualization.PNG\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 550px;\"/>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The visualization is a Slide show showing how Facebook compares to other tech IPO's. It can be viewed in the following link:\n",
    "    https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/17/business/dealbook/how-the-facebook-offering-compares.html?ref=technology\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Explain how it achieves (1)-(3). It might be useful to use screenshots to illustrate your explanation.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "     **(1)** On the first slide an overview is given of previous IPO's to set the scene. **(2)** On the following slides zoom is used to change the users perspective. **(3)** At all times its possible to hower over the companies to get details on demand. It is also possible to search for a specific company.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Explain in your own words: How is explanatory data analysis different from exploratory data analysis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanatory data analysis is used to communicate results from a dataset to an audience, which means that the way the results are visualized is of utmost importance. Explanatory data analysis is all about creating a narrative through varius visualization strategies, that is engaging for the user. \n",
    "On the other hand exploratory data analysis is usefull for figuring out what narrative (if any) the dataset is able to tell.  "
